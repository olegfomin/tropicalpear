The game consists of multiple rounds. In each round players are presented a question, a choice of answers, and have to select one answer within the allotted time (10 seconds or so). Players that chose a correct answer advance to the next round. Those who chose the wrong answers are eliminated. The game continues until there’s only one winner left. There is no administrator or moderator in this game as any user can create a new game specifying the alloted time for each round and the minimal number of users after which the game starts. A user who created a game can delete its own game if it is still in a 'waiting' state. Any user can join a created game in a 'waiting' state. As a game has started it cannot be joined in a middle anymore. At the end of a game each user receives the statistic of about player choices at the end of each round (how many players have chosen each answer). Every user must specify their name which is currently not verified for uniqueness. The pool of questions is not configurable by the end user for now.
